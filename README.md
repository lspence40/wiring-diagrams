some pictures of the wiring of the stuff in my circuitpython/advanced circuitpython repo.

RGBledWiring.PNG has two RGBLEDs and many (6) resitors. RGBLEDs (red, green, blue light emitting diodes) are little lights that can be set to be any color. resistors make there not be so mmuch current going through the LEDs that they burn out.

button_count_LCDWiring.PNG contains a 16x2 LCD screen, a breadboard pushbutton, and a SPDT switch. a LCD (liquid crystal display) screen is a bunch of little squares that are full of a type of crystal that lights up when electricity is run through them.

fancyLEDWiring.PNG has 6 LEDs, 3 blue and 3 green. requalr LEDs can only be sets to one color, but there are 6 of them. also there are more resistors.

photointerrupter_LCD_thingWiring.PNG uses a photointerrupter and another (actually the same) LCD screen. a photointerrupter has two parts, the first of which is an infrared laser. infrared light is a frequency of light that is harmless, but invisible to humans. the second part is a sensor that can tell if an infrared laser is being shined into it. it gives a signal if nothing is inbetween the things, and doesn't if something is.
